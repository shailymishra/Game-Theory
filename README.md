#### Game Theory Projects

-  Built an agent in a team of three in Java to play a very simplified version of Ad Exchange(Adx) in Trading Agent Competition (TAC) in which agents need to bid for ads to fulfill their campaigns efficiently.

- Created a program in python to find strategies (mini-max, pure nash, mixed strategy) for a two-player zero-sum game (nfg file format).
